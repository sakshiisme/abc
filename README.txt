abc_original_colors.zip - build notes

This package preserves your ORIGINAL color palette and theme while adding:
- Mobile-first responsive fixes
- Subtle, professional reveal-on-scroll animations
- Smooth button hover and press transitions
- Lazy-loading for non-hero images (loading="lazy")
- final.css and final.js included for UX enhancements, but color overrides removed so your styles take priority

How to use:
1. Unzip and upload the folder to your static host (Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages).
2. Test on devices and run Lighthouse for further improvements.
3. If any specific section needs micro-tuning, contact me with the page and device size.

Notes:
- I removed color variables from final.css so your original styles.css controls colors completely.
- Animations remain subtle and professional as requested.
